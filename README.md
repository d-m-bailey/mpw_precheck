# MPW Precheck

| :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation:  Important Note  :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Although still possible, running the mpw-precheck from outside Docker is no longer supported by efabless. If you choose to run directly through python, you bare full responsibility for the generated results |

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Setup

### Docker

You can either build the docker locally or fetch it from dockerhub.

#### Build Docker Locally

To build the necessary docker locally, run:

```bash
    cd dependencies
    sh build-docker.sh
```

#### Pull Docker from Dockerhub

To pull the necessary docker from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/efabless/mpw_precheck/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated), run:

```bash
    docker pull efabless/mpw_precheck:latest
```

### Install the PDK

If you don't have the pdk installed, please refer to the [caravel](https://github.com/efabless/caravel.git) Makefile.

## Before Using

- Before you run the precheck tool, make sure you go through https://opensource.google/docs/releasing/preparing/ and cover the requirements.

- Overwrite `verilog/gl/user_project_wrapper.v` with your synthesized netlist **make sure the netlist includes power information**. Keep on reading for this point to make more sense.

- Make sure you have the top level GDS-II under a directory called `gds/`; thus containing `gds/user_project_wrapper.gds`, this directory should be compressed and the script will use your Makefile to uncompress it.

- Please create a file `./third_party/used_external_repos.csv` and add to it all `repository name,commit hash` for any external github repository that you are using to build this project.

- Please include any useful statistics about your design, i.e. cell count, core utilization, etc. in a `.csv` file under `./signoff/<macro-name>/final_summary_report.csv`. If you're using OpenLANE then, this file should be created
  automatically in `<run path>/reports/final_summary_report.csv`.

## What Does the Script Do?

It runs a sequence of checks and aborts with the appropriate error message(s) if any of them fails.

The steps are as follows:

- **License**:
  - The root directory of the project, submodules and third party libraries contain at least one approved license and does not contain any prohibitted license
  - All source files contain an approved SPDX License and Copyright Headers
- **Makefile**:
  - Makefile targets contain at least compression and uncompression for the user_project_wrapper.gds file
- **Defaults**:
  - Contents of the project are different from the default content in [caravel_user_project](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project.git) for digital projects
    and [caravel_user_project_analog](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project_analog.git)
  - The user_project_wrapper.gds must be different from the default one found in [caravel_user_project](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project.git) for digital projects
    and [caravel_user_project_analog](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project_analog.git) for analog projects
- **Documentation**:
  - Documentation file README.md exists and does not use any non-inclusive language
- **Consistency**:
  - Runs a series of checks on the user netlist (user_project_wrapper/user_analog_project_wrapper), and the top netlist (caravel/caravan) to make sure that both conform to the constraints put by the golden wrapper.
    - Both Netlists share the following checks:
      - Modeling check: check netlist is structural and doesn't contain behavioral constructs
      - Complexity check: check netlist isn't empty and contains at least eight instances
    - Remaining Top Netlist checks:
      - Sub-module hooks: check the user wrapper submodule port connections match the golden wrapper ports
      - Power check: check all submodules in the netlist are connected to power
    - Remaining User Netlist checks:
      - Ports check: check netlist port names match the golden wrapper ports
      - Layout check: check netlist matches the provided user wrapper layout in terms of the number of instances, and the instance names
- **GPIO Defines**:
  - A verilog directives check that validates the project's 'verilog/rtl/user_defines.v' netlist.
- **XOR**:
  - No modification in the user_project_wrapper(versus default user_project_wrapper.gds in [caravel_user_project](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project.git) for digital projects
    and [caravel_user_project_analog](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project_analog.git) for analog projects) outside the user defined area lower left corner (0,0) and upper right corner (2920, 3520)
- **MagicDRC**:
  - The user_project_wrapper.gds does not have any DRC violations(using magic vlsi tool)
- **KlayoutBEOLDRC**:
  - The user*project_wrapper.gds does not have any DRC violations(using klayout) in the [\_Back End Of Line* layers](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/summary.html)
- **KlayoutFEOLDRC**:
  - The user*project_wrapper.gds does not have any DRC violations(using klayout) in the [\_Front End Of Line* layers](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/summary.html)
- **KlayoutOffgrid**:
  - The user_project_wrapper.gds does not contain any shapes that have offgrid violations(rules [x.1b, x.3a, x.2, x.2c](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/periphery.html))
- **KlayoutMetalMinimumClearAreaDensity**:
  - The user_project_wrapper.gds has metal density (for each of the 5 metal layers) that is the lower than the maximum metal density specified by
    the [li1.pd.ld, m1.pd.ld, m2.pd.ld, m3.pd.ld, m4.pd.ld, m5.pd.ld rules](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/periphery.html)

## Current Assumptions

- The user module name is `user_project_wrapper` (or `user_analog_project_wrapper' for caravel_user_project_analog)
- The mpw precheck is executed from inside it's docker container where a golden copy of caravel exists and is specified by an environment variable called `GOLDEN_CARAVEL`.

## How To Run

Mount the docker file:

```bash
export PDK_PATH=<Absolute path to the desired PDK 'variant specific'.>
export INPUT_DIRECTORY=<Absolute path to the user project path>
sh docker-mount.sh
```

Run the following command:

```
usage: mpw_precheck.py [-h] --input_directory $INPUT_DIRECTORY --pdk_path $PDK_PATH [--output_directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [--private] [check [check ...]]

Runs the precheck tool by calling the various checks in order.

positional arguments:

  check                 Checks to be ran by the precheck (default: None)

optional arguments:

  -h, --help               show this help message and exit

  -i, --input_directory    $INPUT_DIRECTORY
                           INPUT_DIRECTORY, absolute Path to the project. (default: None)

  -p, --pdk_path           $PDK_PATH
                           PDK_PATH, points to the installation path of the pdk 'variant specific' (default: None)

  -o, --output_directory   OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                           OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, default=<input_directory>/precheck_results. (default:None)

  --private                If provided, precheck skips [License, Defaults, Documentation]
                           checks used to qualify the project to as an Open Source Project (default: False)
```
